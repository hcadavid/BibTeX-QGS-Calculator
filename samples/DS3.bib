  doi = {10.1109/ISDFS.2016.7473524},
  abstract = {Biometrics has its own popularity in recent years especially in engineering field. Biometrics related researches have been increasingly handled by scientists to achieve more secure and high performed systems. In low level or higher level designs, there are two basic criterion initially to be considered: area and speed. Hardware designs like in smart cards require less complex circuits in the sense of area. In this study, there will be system related biometric research and implementations by only considering the high level designs. Module based high level design is implemented which includes feature extraction and decision modules. In the first, biometric feature extraction together with relatively new techniques is handled. Fingerprint identification and face recognition are the first part interests by using new operators to reduce the operation complexity. In the second module, the decision of the authentication will be handled by using multi biometrics. Fingerprint and face are popular biometrics. In the feature extraction phase, new method to obtain features is used both for the finger and for the face. New image processing operator, Relational Bit Operator (RBO) is for the face biometry. Besides, Angle Invariant Fingerprint Features Matching Technique (AIFM) is for fingerprint matching. This paper presents the introduction to biometric systems together with literature review. After the design issues are presented, the test results related to biometric authentication metric is added in the final draw of the paper.},

  abstract = {Innovation and value proposition in distance-learning-programs (e-learning programs) is a multifaceted-activity with enormous dimensionality. The implementation of information communication technology (ICT) and enhanced enterprise-resource-planning (eERP) for smart-campuses has emerged as inevitability for industrial competitiveness in smart-factories as per the dictates of total quality management (TQM). The philosophy of productivity-management and concurrent engineering stipulates a competitive framework for e-learning for dissemination and absorption of knowledge by the intelligentsia, technologists and students. Conversely, competitiveness in today's global village demands an innovative and systems-approach for improving the learning-curves in a virtual environment. The e-learning-programs have numerous inherent perplexities since in every virtual classroom there is a much higher probability to interact with orthogonal-cultures that too with multiple-intelligences. This paper proposes a ``conceptual-strategic-planning-framework'' for diffusion of innovative in a distance learning program (Course-Technovation). The framework is based on literature review and field visits encompassing integrated ``E-commerce-model-driven architecture'' embedded with business intelligence and coupled with eERP-design functionalities.},

  abstract = {Energy efficiency has been the subject of discussion throughout the world, not only for optimization of process costs, but also by some crises identified in the energy matrix. On this context, a research agenda for energy efficiency can take assist effect in finding solutions to reduce energy consumption (or smart consumption) in industrial environments. Therefore, the main objective of this paper was to create a research agenda for energy efficiency in industrial environments, using, for this, systematic review of the literature as a fundamental methodology in the search for material that could enhance our understanding of the subject under study, identifying relevant texts to it. Once selected a portfolio of reading, it was possible to outline a statistical look around the literature, proposing indicators for analysis, as authors, countries, institutions, journals, keywords and topics and the development of the research agenda with major authors, themes and magazines. A research agenda on energy efficiency can be the start point for the studies of management practices focused on efficient use of energy. In this study, however, was limited to work only eitgh databases, given the importance in the engineering area.},

The information includes both physical data produced by embedded sensors in the smart device and the observation and reasoning from human participants. However, most of the existing participatory sensing applications lack multi-functional capabilities; they are designed to collect one single or limited types of information. In this paper, we first identify the most important requirements of a multi-purpose participatory sensing application, based on a comprehensive literature review. We then propose a generic participatory sensing framework - Citizense - that emphasizes ease of use, and allows the creation, execution of context-aware, multi-purpose participatory sensing campaigns, and analysis of the results. We discuss the architecture, design and prototype implementation, and compare it against the earlier identified requirements.},

At the core of Industry 4.0 is the smart factory of the future, whose successful deployment requires solving challenges from many domains. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is a key enabler for such complex systems of systems as can be seen by the increased number of related publications in key conferences and journals. This paper aims to characterize the state of the art of MBSE for the smart factory through a systematic mapping study on this topic. Adopting a detailed search strategy, 1466 papers were initially identified. Of these, 222 papers were selected and categorized using a particular classification scheme. Hence, we present the concerns addressed by the modeling community for Industry 4.0, how these are investigated, where these are published, and by whom. The resulting research landscape can help to understand, guide, and compare research in this field. In particular, this paper identifies the Industry 4.0 challenges addressed by the modeling community, but also the challenges that seem to be less investigated.},

However, little work has been put into taking data from the architectures and exercising them in a constructive combat simulation environment, and cannot take the advantage of data-centric approach adopted by DoDAF2.0 either. This paper details a method for finding architecturally feasible alternatives to WESoS capability problems in early phase acquisition using data meta-model (DM2) and agent-based simulation (ABS). Firstly, a literature review of SoS architecture description and executable architecture modeling and analysis was studied, then capabilities-based DM2 (CBDM2) was developed from the view of capability assessment. Next, based on the CBDM2, a method of mapping CBDM2 to ABS system was proposed. The method proposed is a preliminary study on meta-model based architecture development and executable model in constructive combat simulation to WESoS capability assessment.},

This systematic literature review gives an overview of the literature about interoperability assessment methods. A survey was conducted through digital libraries and a total of 42 papers were read. Out of these papers, 24 different interoperability assessment models were identified and analyzed. A striking find of this study is that no proof of industrial adaptation of these models was found. In this paper, we analyze the reasons for this lack of validation in the context of CPS development.},

Where there are numerous applications of smart grid technologies, home energy management is probably the most important one to be addressed. Utilities across the globe have taken various steps for efficient consumption of electricity. New pricing schemes like, Real Time Pricing (RTP), Time of Use (ToU), Inclining Block Rates (IBR), Critical Peak Pricing (CPP) etc, have been proposed for smart grid. Distributed Energy Resources (DER) (local generation) and/or home appliances coordination along with different tariff schemes lead towards efficient consumption of electricity. This work also discusses a HEM system's general architecture and various challenges in implementation of this architecture in smart grid.},

With so many objects connected in IoT solutions, the environment in which they are placed becomes smarter. A software, called middleware, plays a key role since it is responsible for most of the intelligence in IoT, integrating data from devices, allowing them to communicate, and make decisions based on collected data. Then, considering requirements of IoT platforms, a reference architecture model for IoT middleware is analyzed, detailing the best operation approaches of each proposed module, as well as proposes basic security features for this type of software. This paper elaborates on a systematic review of the related literature, exploring the differences between the current Internet and IoT-based systems, presenting a deep discussion of the challenges and future perspectives on IoT middleware. Finally, it highlights the difficulties for achieving and enforcing a universal standard. Thus, it is concluded that middleware plays a crucial role in IoT solutions and the proposed architectural approach can be used as a reference model for IoT middleware.},

  abstract = {Software systems have become increasingly complex, and they are often formed by integrating independent systems, resulting in a new class of systems referenced as System of Systems (SoS). The System of Systems Integration (SoSI) emerges as a new challenge and aims to create a new feature by integrating constituent systems that contribute to the overall goal of the SoS. Often the constituent systems tend to be from different sources and behaviors and, as such, tend to employ different terminology and concepts. Also, when SoSI involves the integration of legacy systems, cases where the documentation and the necessary skills for the harmonious integration are readily available are very rare. However, it is observed that there is a lack of studies that are comprehensive and, at the same time, contain a detailed view of how the constituent systems are integrated in order to collectively achieve a common goal. Based on this scenario, the main contribution of this systematic review (SR) is to investigate the state of the art of SoSI and the software engineering methods that assist in the integration between constituent systems of a SoS. The SR has found 1398 studies and, at the end of the selection process, we selected 29 studies for data extraction. Most studies describe individuals and teams who have worked in isolation to develop solutions to certain problems without widespread adoption of a form of integration. Thus, there is a growing concern of researchers in the SoS context. However, it still lacks research and greater dissemination of concepts among researchers in the field.},

Even with the rapid development in hardware technology, the computing capability and battery capacity on wearable devices and smartphones still cannot meet the application demands with heavy computations and high battery drain. Pervasive computing addresses this problem by migrating applications to the resource providers external to mobile devices. The profitability of this method heavily depends on how to implement it and when to use it. Although there are many computation offloading systems proposed in the literature, there is no practical manual that addresses all the implementation complexities on the way to building a general offloading system. In this article, we review developments in the field of pervasive computing on computation offloading. We use this literature review together with our own experience and provide designers with some detailed guidelines to gain a deep insight into the implementation challenges of a computation offloading system. The guidelines empower the reader to choose between the variety of solutions in the literature for developing any offloading system with the consideration of their own system architecture and available facilities. Finally, we evaluate our general offloading system on Android devices with two real-time applications.},
