  abstract = {It is widely held that debugging cyber-physical systems (CPS) is challenging; many strongly held beliefs exist regarding how CPS are currently debugged and tested and the suitability of various techniques. For instance, dissenting opinions exist as to whether formal methods (including static analysis, theorem proving, and model checking) are appropriate in CPS verification and validation. Simulation tools and simulation-based testing are also often considered insufficient for CPS. Many ``experts'' posit that high-level programming languages (e.g., Java or C\#) are not applicable to CPS due to their inability to address (significant) resource constraints at a high level of abstraction. To date, empirical studies investigating these questions have not been done. In this paper, we qualitatively and quantitatively analyze why debugging CPS remains challenging and either dispel or confirm these strongly held beliefs along the way. Specifically, we report on a structured online survey of 25 CPS researchers (10 participants classified themselves as CPS developers), semistructured interviews with nine practitioners across four continents, and a qualitative literature review. We report these results and discuss several implications for research and practice related to CPS.},

  doi = {10.1109/CoDIT.2016.7593580},
  abstract = {Self-adaptive intelligent vehicle system has become more attractive due to its capability of adaptation to varying and stochastic environments in an efficient and autonomous manner. The dynamic demeanor in adaptation and reconfiguration of intelligent vehicle systems will facilitate the existing federal and civil construction in better planning as well as in abbreviating the huge amount of budget of government and will ameliorate and impoverish the day to day lifestyle of mass generation with enhanced efficiency in green-energy oriented transportation systems. However, such systems may be prone to runtime failures when the overall environmental dynamics as well as the required parameters cannot be adequately considered during design time. In this project, we have examined and investigated the typical safety critical issues using SMT solver on a speed synchronization racing car example in both design and implementation level. In the design level, a Petri Net model is adopted as the high level abstraction of the racing car. In the implementation level, the system was developed in Java and Lejos package since the application toolkit is LEGO mindstorm EV3 robotic kit. In addition to this, both a set of safety properties and Petri Net model was rewritten in Z3 specification, where the safety properties are verified against the system model. The observed results of the specified properties have demonstrated that all required system constraints for hardware and firmware were analyzed and verified on an optimized version of Petri Net model of the system. This is the first time, from our literature review, to see the validation of the both design and implementation level using SMT Solver. Furthermore, this result has provided strong and rigid foundation for the runtime verification of cyber physical systems.},

  doi = {10.1109/SESoS.2016.014},
  abstract = {Software systems have become increasingly complex, and they are often formed by integrating independent systems, resulting in a new class of systems referenced as System of Systems (SoS). The System of Systems Integration (SoSI) emerges as a new challenge and aims to create a new feature by integrating constituent systems that contribute to the overall goal of the SoS. Often the constituent systems tend to be from different sources and behaviors and, as such, tend to employ different terminology and concepts. Also, when SoSI involves the integration of legacy systems, cases where the documentation and the necessary skills for the harmonious integration are readily available are very rare. However, it is observed that there is a lack of studies that are comprehensive and, at the same time, contain a detailed view of how the constituent systems are integrated in order to collectively achieve a common goal. Based on this scenario, the main contribution of this systematic review (SR) is to investigate the state of the art of SoSI and the software engineering methods that assist in the integration between constituent systems of a SoS. The SR has found 1398 studies and, at the end of the selection process, we selected 29 studies for data extraction.

Thus, there is a growing concern of researchers in the SoS context. However, it still lacks research and greater dissemination of concepts among researchers in the field.},

Together, these constituents can accomplish missions that otherwise could not be performed by any of them separately. In another perspective, knowledge representation approaches can assist in the establishment of a common understanding in this field by formalizing and standardizing the main terms and concepts adopted. In spite of the relevance of SoS, a consolidated terminology which could support the community working with such systems is still missing. Furthermore, the multiplicity of stakeholders, technologies, and expertise involved in an SoS makes the need of a common understanding even more imperative. In this study, we report on the main findings of a systematic literature review covering knowledge representation approaches in the SoS field. With this study, we are able to present a comprehensive panorama of the knowledge representation approaches that are currently adopted. Even though a consolidated terminology is not available yet, such panorama can be helpful for devising a common, comprehensive terminology for the SoS field. Therefore, we conclude this paper with directions for future work.},

  doi = {10.1109/TKDE.2015.2496199},
  abstract = {Maintaining the freshness of real-time data is one of the crucial design issues in cyber-physical systems (CPS). Past studies have focused on designing update algorithms to minimize the workload imposed by a fixed set of update tasks while ensuring the temporal validity of data. In this paper, we revisit this problem in dynamic cyber-physical systems (DCPS) which may exhibit multi-modal behavior. Any solution to this problem must recognize that: (1) different update algorithms may be needed in different modes according to the workload in each mode, and (2) temporal validity of data must be maintained not only in each mode but also during the mode switch. To strike a balance between data freshness and system schedulability, we propose a utilization-based scheduling selection (UBSS) strategy. We first introduce two synchronous mode switch algorithms, named search-based switch (SBS) and adjustment-based switch (ABS) to search for the proper switch point online and execute all update tasks in the new mode synchronously. SBS checks for temporal validity at the beginning time slot of each idle period in the schedule, while ABS relaxes this restriction through schedule adjustment. To support immediate mode switch, we propose an asynchronous switch algorithm named instant switch (IS) to reduce the switch delay. IS schedules outstanding jobs from the old mode together with the jobs in the new mode using the least-available-laxity-first scheduling policy. Our experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of these three algorithms. They also show that UBSS strategy can significantly outperform a single fixed update algorithm in terms of maintaining better data freshness while incurring only limited online switch overhead.},

These issues have been addressed in the semiconductor industry since the early 1980s and some solutions have become well-established standards. Hence, the semiconductor industry can provide guidelines for a transition towards Industry 4.0 in other manufacturing domains. In this work, the methodologies of Industry 4.0, cyber-physical systems and Big data processes are discussed.

Understanding these interdependencies is a critical precursor to accurate representation and modeling of the CPS as a whole, especially with respect to dependability.The physical water distribution infrastructure, coupled with the hardware and software that support intelligent water allocation, comprise the model CPS that will be used as a case study for the proposed research. A preliminary literature review has been carried out on dependability modeling for CPS, with very sparse results. Allocation algorithms for water distribution have also been investigated,with game theory appearing to hold the most promise.An agent-based approach is suggested for linking the cyber and physical layers, where the agents retrieve information from sensors monitoring the physical components and provide this information to the cyber components. Fault injection will be used to investigate the propagation of failures between the cyber and physical layers. Markovian models will be used to capture the manifestation of cyber and/or physical faults as failures in water allocation, or containment of contaminants.},

This paper aims to characterize the state of the art of MBSE for the smart factory through a systematic mapping study on this topic.

  abstract = {Nowadays, change is an important aspect of the world. Complexity and change in requirements and environments bring us to Autonomic Systems as a solution. Like any other kind of software system, better implementation of a system needs a proper evaluation method for system implementation. To evaluate a Self-Adaptive system, appropriate quality factors are needed for evaluation. This research tries to use non-adaptive system's evaluation methods to evaluate Self-Adaptive ones. The qualitative factors for self-adaptive systems have been extracted from a literature review (as Self-Adaptive System Qualitative Factors or for abbreviation SAQFs). Hence, there is no explicit or even implicit way for measuring most of the SAQFs, This research has tried to measure them through some measurable Qualitative Criterion. These Qualitative Criteria (we call them QCs) consist of some self-adaptive systems attributes and also some non-adaptive systems' qualitative factors. A map between these SAQFs and software system's QCs (which are more measurable) have been introduced. For each QC, sufficient metrics for measuring could be dug up based on the problem context. For better knowing about the influence of qualitative factors on each other, a prerequisite and post-requisite graph from relations among SAQFs have been introduced. This relational graph shows the importance and impact of each factors measurement on measuring the systems from self-adaptive viewpoint. For evaluating the method, we have proposed a questionnaire to experts about the model the correctness of these impacts and influences have been verified. In addition, a case study on a system in changing environment evaluated with proposed method and the applicability of the method have been reviewed.},

To better understand the evolution of interoperability and its influence in the building of contemporary software systems we undertook a quasi-Systematic Literature Review to collect interoperability characteristics regarding context-awareness software systems. Five dimensions (ability to exchange, cooperation, integration, system relation, and property) and seven characteristics (adaptive behavior, availability, compatibility, conformance with organization requirements, conformance with system's requirements, dynamic connection, Standardization) of interoperability emerged from the findings. They should be taken into account when developing a contemporary software system. Besides, they suggest that interoperability can be thought as the ability of things (an object, a place, an application or anything that can engage an interaction in a system) to interact for a specific purpose, once their differences (development platforms, data formats, culture, legal issues) have been overcome.},

In order to take these developments into account, a bibliographic literature review following earlier studies was performed. Within that context, the evolution of CPS terminology, based on the available scientific literature, was examined, resulting in the identification of not only actual and potential application areas but also an overview of scientific journals and institutions, which distinguish themselves within corresponding research and publication efforts. Finally, these investigations were merged together to provide a general overview in the sense of an actual research map of relevant CPS research.},

  abstract = {Context: Cyber-physical systems (CPS) seamlessly integrate computational and physical components. Adaptability, realized through feedback loops, is a key requirement to deal with uncertain operating conditions in CPS. Objective: We aim at assessing state-of-art approaches to handle self-adaptation in CPS at the architectural level. Method: We conducted a systematic literature review by searching four major scientific data bases, resulting in 1103 candidate studies and eventually retaining 42 primary studies included for data collection after applying inclusion and exclusion criteria. Results: The primary concerns of adaptation in CPS are performance, flexibility, and reliability. 64\% of the studies apply adap- tation at the application layer and 24\% at the middleware layer. MAPE (Monitor-Analyze-Plan-Execute) is the dominant adaptation mechanism (60\%), followed by agents and self-organization (both 29\%). Remarkably, 36\% of the studies combine differ- ent mechanisms to realize adaptation; 17\% combine MAPE with agents. The dominating application domain is energy (24\%). Conclusions: Our findings show that adaptation in CPS is a cross-layer concern, where solutions combine different adaptation mechanisms within and across layers. This raises challenges for future research both in the field of CPS and self-adaptation, including: how to map concerns to layers and adaptation mechanisms, how to coordinate adaptation mechanisms within and across layers, and how to ensure system-wide consistency of adaptation.},

  abstract = {Modeling and Simulation is important at all stages of weapon equipment system-of-systems (WESoS) development. However, little work has been put into taking data from the architectures and exercising them in a constructive combat simulation environment, and cannot take the advantage of data-centric approach adopted by DoDAF2.0 either. This paper details a method for finding architecturally feasible alternatives to WESoS capability problems in early phase acquisition using data meta-model (DM2) and agent-based simulation (ABS). Firstly, a literature review of SoS architecture description and executable architecture modeling and analysis was studied, then capabilities-based DM2 (CBDM2) was developed from the view of capability assessment. Next, based on the CBDM2, a method of mapping CBDM2 to ABS system was proposed. The method proposed is a preliminary study on meta-model based architecture development and executable model in constructive combat simulation to WESoS capability assessment.},

  abstract = {Vehicle platooning has been studied for several decades, with objectives such as improved traffic throughput on existing infrastructure or reduced energy consumption. All the time, it has been apparent that safety is an important issue. However, there are no comprehensive analyses of what is needed to achieve safety in platooning, but only scattered pieces of information. This paper investigates, through a systematic literature review, what is known about safety for platooning, including what analysis methods have been used, what hazards and failures have been identified, and solution elements that have been proposed to improve safety. Based on this, a gap analysis is performed to identify outstanding questions that need to be addressed in future research. These include dealing with a business ecosystem of actors that cooperate and compete around platooning, refining safety analysis methods to make them suitable for systems-of-systems, dealing with variability in vehicles, and finding solutions to various human factors issues.},

  volume = {4},
  doi = {10.1109/JIOT.2017.2703172},
  abstract = {With the exponential growth of cyber-physical systems (CPSs), new security challenges have emerged. Various vulnerabilities, threats, attacks, and controls have been introduced for the new generation of CPS. However, there lacks a systematic review of the CPS security literature. In particular, the heterogeneity of CPS components and the diversity of CPS systems have made it difficult to study the problem with one generalized model. In this paper, we study and systematize existing research on CPS security under a unified framework. The framework consists of three orthogonal coordinates: 1) from the security perspective, we follow the well-known taxonomy of threats, vulnerabilities, attacks and controls; 2) from the CPS components perspective, we focus on cyber, physical, and cyberphysical components; and 3) from the CPS systems perspective, we explore general CPS features as well as representative systems (e.g., smart grids, medical CPS, and smart cars). The model can be both abstract to show general interactions of components in a CPS application, and specific to capture any details when needed. By doing so, we aim to build a model that is abstract enough to be applicable to various heterogeneous CPS applications; and to gain a modular view of the tightly coupled CPS components. Such abstract decoupling makes it possible to gain a systematic understanding of CPS security, and to highlight the potential sources of attacks and ways of protection. With this intensive literature review, we attempt to summarize the state-of-the-art on CPS security, provide researchers with a comprehensive list of references, and also encourage the audience to further explore this emerging field.},

  abstract = {This paper introduces the SmartDisability Framework; a System of Systems to consider mappings between the Disability Types, Range of Movement and Interaction Mediums to produce Technology and Task recommendations. Each element is seen as a constituent system that relies on interaction between the user and technology. The recommended technologies are viewed as independent and operable constituent systems that are networked together to assist people with disability. The SmartDisability conceptual model (based on the familiar disability symbol) and extracts from the initial development stage of the framework are presented. The framework has been populated through a systematic literature review of disability classification, Range of Movement, interaction mediums, ‘off-the-shelf' technologies and tasks. The framework was augmented by the results of a previously conducted requirements elicitation process, involving surveys and semi-structured interviews, and a user evaluation with head tracking technology. Quality Function Deployment determined the relationships within the framework to ensure that user requirements were fully analysed. The anticipated validation process involving a focus group utilising fictional personas and routes to exploitation (through the development of an application) are also discussed.},
