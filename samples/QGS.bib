  abstract = {Software systems have become increasingly complex, and they are often formed by integrating independent systems, resulting in a new class of systems referenced as System of Systems (SoS). The System of Systems Integration (SoSI) emerges as a new challenge and aims to create a new feature by integrating constituent systems that contribute to the overall goal of the SoS. Often the constituent systems tend to be from different sources and behaviors and, as such, tend to employ different terminology and concepts. Also, when SoSI involves the integration of legacy systems, cases where the documentation and the necessary skills for the harmonious integration are readily available are very rare. However, it is observed that there is a lack of studies that are comprehensive and, at the same time, contain a detailed view of how the constituent systems are integrated in order to collectively achieve a common goal. Based on this scenario, the main contribution of this systematic review (SR) is to investigate the state of the art of SoSI and the software engineering methods that assist in the integration between constituent systems of a SoS. The SR has found 1398 studies and, at the end of the selection process, we selected 29 studies for data extraction. Most studies describe individuals and teams who have worked in isolation to develop solutions to certain problems without widespread adoption of a form of integration. Thus, there is a growing concern of researchers in the SoS context. However, it still lacks research and greater dissemination of concepts among researchers in the field.},

  abstract = {Systems-of-systems (SoS) represent a class of systems resulted from the interaction among independent systems that cooperate to form a larger and more complex system aiming at accomplishing global missions. An inherent characteristic of SoS is the high heterogeneity of their constituent systems, which are distributed, independent, and developed with different technologies. In addition, SoS are highly dynamic, so that their constituents are often partially known or even unknown at design time. As a consequence, these constituent systems need to be discovered, selected, and composed at runtime towards identifying the proper arrangements that contribute to the accomplishment of the global missions of the SoS. In this paper, we present the results of a systematic mapping aimed to investigate the existing approaches to discover and compose constituent systems within an SoS. Besides providing an overview of the state of the art on these topics, we shed light on important issues to be addressed by future research towards a more effective development of SoS.},

  abstract = {The research area systems-of-systems engineering has increased rapidly over the last decade and now contains a substantial body of literature. To get an overview of the field, a systematic mapping of the literature has been done, covering over 3000 papers. It revealed a field massively dominated by US researchers, with an emphasis on military and space systems. A large number of people are involved, but few researchers focus on the area, and citations are fairly low compared to other fields. Important research topics include architecture, modeling and simulation, integration and interoperability, communication, sustainability, and safety and security. There are signs of immaturity within the research area, and it is recommended that existing venues are complemented with an international scientific event with very high standards for submissions.},

These things can be engaged in complex relationships including the composition and collaboration with other independent and heterogeneous systems in order to provide new functionalities, thus leading to the so-called systems-of-systems (SoS).

  abstract = {Context: A system of systems is an assemblage of components which individually may be regarded as systems, and which possesses the additional properties that the constituent systems are operationally independent, and are managerially independent. Much has been published about the field of systems of systems by researchers and practitioners, often with the assertion that the system-of-systems design context necessitates the use of architecture approaches that are somewhat different from system-level architecture. However, no systematic review has been conducted to provide an extensive overview of system of systems architecture research. Objective: This paper presents such a systematic review. The objective of this review is to classify and provide a thematic analysis of the reported results in system of systems architecture. Method: The primary studies for the systematic review were identified using a predefined search strategy followed by an extensive manual selection process. Results: We found the primary studies published in a large number of venues, mostly domain-oriented, with no obvious center of a research community of practice. The field seems to be maturing more slowly than other software technologies: Most reported results described individuals or teams working in apparent isolation to develop solutions to particular system-of-systems architecture problems, with no techniques gaining widespread adoption. Conclusions: A comprehensive research agenda for this field should be developed, and further studies should be performed to determine whether the information system-related problems of system of systems architecture are covered by existing software architecture knowledge, and if not, to develop general methods for system-of-systems architecture.},

  abstract = {System-of-Systems (SoS) have been considered the new trend of software systems for several reasons, such as the advancement of computer technology and the increasing complexity and size of the systems. The concept of SoS has the central idea of a set of operationally independent software systems that collaborate together to compose a larger and more complex system. For SoS, several quality attributes are critical due to its characteristics and domain constraints. However, the existent quality models were not conceived to address SoS. Therefore, the identification of quality models that can address the quality attributes for SoS needs to be investigated. So, the purpose of this work is to identify the most common quality attributes in SoS context and analyze their coverage by the well established ISO/IEC 25010 quality model. As a result, we have identified that the current quality models cannot address the complex interdependencies between SoS quality attributes due its dynamic nature.},

  abstract = {Software architectures have been recognized as the backbone to the success of any software system. In addition, they are responsible to aggregate quality attributes, such as interoperability, dependability, and maintainability, to these systems. In parallel, currently, a new class of complex software systems has emerged, referred as Systems of Systems (SoS), resulting from a number of operationally and managerially independent software systems working together to fulfill a mission that none system alone could provide. Considering their complexity, the development of SoS has demanded special attention to their software architectures. In this scenario, the description of such architectures, i.e., the way that these architectures are represented/documented, becomes quite important as it can improve communication as well as evaluation and maintenance of these architectures. Despite its relevance, there is still no complete panorama about architectural descriptions of SoS. The main contribution of this paper is to present results of a Systematic Literature Review (SLR) on how SoS software architectures have been described. As main result, there are already important contributions in that direction; however, there is a lack of consensus on how better dealing with these descriptions. We conclude this paper with directions on how a consensus could be achieved and which aspects of the SoS architectural descriptions require further investigation.},

  abstract = {Software-intensive systems have become increasingly large and complex and new techniques and methodologies are necessary to deal with such complexity. Model-Driven Development (MDD) has been used to deal with complex scenarios, since software models, despite details, facilitate the visualization of the whole. Moreover, MDD has been widely recognized as a way to assure quality, reducing time and effort, and making possible the automatic transformation of models to generate source code. In this direction, software-intensive Systems-of-Systems (SoS) is a class of software systems that have emerged over the iminence of large systems which have a high-level of complexity. Considering the success of MDD in other areas, we decided to investigate how MDD has been used in the context of SoS. This paper presents results of a Systematic Literature Review conducted to scrutinize and bring to light the state of the art in the field of MDD for SoS. Besides that, we discuss future research directions and perspectives, aiming at contributing to the development of SoS.},
