  abstract = {Abstract New automated intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) sensors and processing technologies provide access to ever increasing amounts of intelligence data. Effectively managing these technologies represents a profound system of systems challenge. In this study, we use system dynamics simulation to analyze and assess processing, exploitation, and dissemination (PED) system performance across a range of task areas for converting collected sensor data into information and intelligence. The resulting recommendations identify emerging research, technologies, and support tools than can improve future military \{PED\} system design and performance. The analytic approach used in this study involved three tasks. First, work domain analysis based on recent \{PED\} research and doctrinal reviews were combined with knowledge gleaned from interviews with subject matter experts to identify patterns of cognitive work and categorize emerging \{PED\} system challenges. Second, we searched for an appropriate methodology and chose to take a system dynamics (SD) analysis approach to explore these challenges. This \{SD\} approach was then extended based on Cognitive Systems Engineering [6] insights and applied in a limited and controlled operational scenario to verify its efficacy. The outputs from the \{SD\} simulation were then used to identify initial findings for further analysis coupled with a \{CSE\} work domain analysis to provide a basis for future support technology research and development recommendations.},

  abstract = {There is an urgent need for a trans-disciplinary approach for the collective evaluation of engineered nanomaterial (ENM) benefits and risks. Currently, research studies are mostly focused on examining effects at individual end-points with emphasis on ENM risk effects. Less research work is pursuing the integration needed to advance the science of sustainable ENMs. Therefore, the primary objective of this article is to discuss the system-of-systems (SoS) approach as a broad and integrated paradigm to examine ENM benefits and risks to society, environment, and economy (SEE) within a sustainability context. The aims are focused on: (a) current approaches in the scientific literature and the need for a broad and integrated approach, (b) documentation of ENM SoS in terms of architecture and governing rules and practices within sustainability context, and (c) implementation plan for the road ahead. In essence, the SoS architecture is a communication vehicle offering the opportunity to track benefits and risks in an integrated fashion so as to understand the implications and make decisions about advancing the science of sustainable ENMs. In support of the SoS architecture, we propose using an analytic-based decision support system consisting of a knowledge base and analytic engine along the benefit and risk informatics routes in the SEE system to build sound decisions on what constitutes sustainable and unsustainable ENMs in spite of the existing uncertainties and knowledge gaps. The work presented herein is neither a systematic review nor a critical appraisal of the scientific literature. Rather, it is a position paper that largely expresses the views of the authors based on their expert opinion drawn from industrial and academic experience. (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier B.V.},

  abstract = {The importance and complexity of the problems associated with coordinating multiple organizations to configure value propositions for customers has drawn the attention of multiple disciplines. In an effort to clarify and consolidate terms, this conceptual research examines both supply chain management (SCM) and system of systems (SoS) literature to postulate, from a value-chain perspective, what roles integration and collaboration play in helping supply chains satisfy customer requirements. A literature review analysis was used to identify the commonalities and differences between supply chain management and system of systems approaches to examining interfirm coordination of value creation efforts. Although a framework of integration and collaboration roles in value creation is proposed, further empirical testing of the concept is required to substantiate initial conclusions. The concepts proposed may help clarify where strategic and operational managers need to focus their efforts in coordinating supply chain member firms. The incorporation of SoS engineering into the supply chain field will draw the linkage between the constituent principles, and concepts of Systems Theory as appropriate for the supply chain management field. This is the first effort to reconcile two separate but parallel scholarship streams examining the coordination of multiple organizations in value creation. This research shows that there are some methodologies, principles, and methods from the SoS field that can supplement supply chain management research. Mainly due to a unit of analysis issue, systems based approaches have not been in the mainstream of supply chain management field development.},

However, little work has been put into taking data from the architectures and exercising them in a constructive combat simulation environment, and cannot take the advantage of data-centric approach adopted by DoDAF2.0 either. This paper details a method for finding architecturally feasible alternatives to WESoS capability problems in early phase acquisition using data meta-model (DM2) and agent-based simulation (ABS). Firstly, a literature review of SoS architecture description and executable architecture modeling and analysis was studied, then capabilities-based DM2 (CBDM2) was developed from the view of capability assessment. Next, based on the CBDM2, a method of mapping CBDM2 to ABS system was proposed. The method proposed is a preliminary study on meta-model based architecture development and executable model in constructive combat simulation to WESoS capability assessment.},

  abstract = {Software systems have become increasingly complex, and they are often formed by integrating independent systems, resulting in a new class of systems referenced as System of Systems (SoS). The System of Systems Integration (SoSI) emerges as a new challenge and aims to create a new feature by integrating constituent systems that contribute to the overall goal of the SoS. Often the constituent systems tend to be from different sources and behaviors and, as such, tend to employ different terminology and concepts. Also, when SoSI involves the integration of legacy systems, cases where the documentation and the necessary skills for the harmonious integration are readily available are very rare. However, it is observed that there is a lack of studies that are comprehensive and, at the same time, contain a detailed view of how the constituent systems are integrated in order to collectively achieve a common goal. Based on this scenario, the main contribution of this systematic review (SR) is to investigate the state of the art of SoSI and the software engineering methods that assist in the integration between constituent systems of a SoS. The SR has found 1398 studies and, at the end of the selection process, we selected 29 studies for data extraction. Most studies describe individuals and teams who have worked in isolation to develop solutions to certain problems without widespread adoption of a form of integration. Thus, there is a growing concern of researchers in the SoS context. However, it still lacks research and greater dissemination of concepts among researchers in the field.},

At the core of Industry 4.0 is the smart factory of the future, whose successful deployment requires solving challenges from many domains. Model-based systems engineering (MBSE) is a key enabler for such complex systems of systems as can be seen by the increased number of related publications in key conferences and journals. This paper aims to characterize the state of the art of MBSE for the smart factory through a systematic mapping study on this topic. Adopting a detailed search strategy, 1466 papers were initially identified. Of these, 222 papers were selected and categorized using a particular classification scheme. Hence, we present the concerns addressed by the modeling community for Industry 4.0, how these are investigated, where these are published, and by whom. The resulting research landscape can help to understand, guide, and compare research in this field. In particular, this paper identifies the Industry 4.0 challenges addressed by the modeling community, but also the challenges that seem to be less investigated.},

  abstract = {Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) know a tremendous interest in many fields thanks to their wide range of applications. UAS are complex ``system of systems'' because, in addition to stringent safety and embedded constraints, they incorporate heterogeneous interacting sub-systems. Adequate development approaches and tools have to be provided to deal with this complexity. A literature review concerning this perspective shows a lack because current UAS simulation tools focus on limited or isolated development application. We propose a system-level simulation platform for the development of UAS. The proposed platform supports a component-based design for the UAS where each component is developed using a based-model methodology. A network-oriented architecture and object-oriented conception was adopted to design the platform. This allows the latter to be modular, flexible and integrate many UAS components simultaneously. A Controller Area Network (CAN) data bus is integrated to the platform. It will permit a ``smooth'' transition from the simulation phase to experimentation phase. To accelerate the platform design, a COTS flight simulator is integrated. This latter implements the dynamic, graphic and environmental model of the aircraft.},
