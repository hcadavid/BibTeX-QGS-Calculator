				<p>Smart cities are gaining increasingly more importance in both research and business circles. Much effort is spent to defining what a smart city is and how it could be realized with today&apos;s or future technologies. However, from requirements engineering perspective, our knowledge of smart cities is fragmented; little is known about the requirements for smart cities as complex systems, or as systems of systems, in specific application domains. In this paper, we elicit requirements for smart city systems by carrying out a systematic review of scientific literature focused on the so-called &quot;hard&quot; domains of smart cities. Based on 32 selected publications, we gathered and classified requirements in respect to three types of smart city systems (instrumented, interconnected, and intelligent systems) and four classes of requirements: end-to-end experience, architectural, security, and infrastructure requirements. Our most important findings are that: (1) most authors took a bottom-up approach to defining requirements for smart cities; their efforts focused mainly on requirements important for designing an architecture that could scale up to any size and include any device or system; and (2) very little is mentioned on the newly emerging security and privacy challenges that are critical to gain the citizens&apos; acceptance of smart city apps.</p>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>INTRODUCTION</head><p>The concept of a smart city has been existing in the scientific literature for nearly two decades (i.e. since 1998). However, only in the past 7-8 years, there is a noticeable increase of the volume of scientific publications on this topic <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>. The initial vision of the smart city systems (SCSs) community was to find out a concept or a model that leverages ICT (information and communication technology) for the purpose of improving urban services and resolving various daily problems that affect citizens' life. The peak of this initial vision is the work of Harrison et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> proposing the foundational concept of a SCS in 2010. These authors defined three types of SCSs: instrumented, interconnected and intelligent systems. Their classification contributed significantly to the creation of an initial understanding of smart cities and to the definition of a structure applicable to a wide range of cities. However, these authors focused only on technical aspects whereas a smart city is far of being limited to the application of technologies to cities. In fact, authors of recent scientific publications increasingly more emphasize the inclusion of ""people aspects" in the conceptualization of SCSs, e.g. Giffinger <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> proposed to measure the cities' smartness footprint according to six characteristics âˆ’ smart economy, smart people, smart governance, smart mobility, smart environment, and smart living, all of which refer to citizens and communities. There are also some more recent attempts to define the concept of smart city as urban living labs or as knowledgeable cities, which also focus on people. Plus, the 2015 definitional analysis of Albino et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19]</ref> identified 23 different definitions for a smart city in the scientific literature that include people and community needs. Although much work took place to clarify the concept of smart cities, to the best of our knowledge very little has been published on the requirements that are posed to these systems and that are traceable to their characteristic dimensions that researchers and practitioners deemed important. As a result, our knowledge of these systems from a requirements engineering perspective, is fragmented. Our research makes a step towards bridging this gap. The goal of this paper is to identify, structure and consolidate the SCSs' requirements that have been treated in publications on smart cities. Using the systematic literature review techniques of <ref type="bibr">Kitchenham et al. [38]</ref>, we identified 32 relevant publications and, then, extracted and aggregated the requirements discussed in them.</p><p>For the purpose of our research, we use Kondepudi's working definition: "A smart sustainable city (SSC) is an innovative city that uses information and communication technologies (ICTs) and other means to improve quality of life, efficiency of urban operation and services, and competitiveness, while ensuring that it meets the needs of present and future generations with respect to economic, social and environmental aspects" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>). According to it, businesses providing SCSs, approach the solution development process from two angles <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>: technology-intense ("hard") and sociallyintense ("soft"). The first angle implies a strong focus on delivering cyber-physical systems, while the second -on sociotechnical systems ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref> </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>II. RESEARCH PROCESS</head><p>Our research process implemented the guidelines in <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref>. It included the following steps: planning a paper search strategy, formulating inclusion and exclusion criteria for paper selection, searching literature sources, evaluating these sources based on the inclusion criteria, and analyzing the empirical evidence in those paper that we selected for inclusion. Our search was done in the Scopus digital library. We chose Scopus because (1) it is the largest database of peer-reviewed literature (as stated by Elsevier, https://www.elsevier.com/solutions/ scopus) and (2) recent bibliographic research <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">42]</ref> indicated it as the most comprehensive and user-friendly database. Using Scopus means that the results only contain papers which are published in peer-reviewed journals, conferences and workshops (and that no master's and PhD theses are included). We used the following search string: (("smart city" OR "smart city system" OR "smart city software" OR "smart city solution") AND (requirements OR architecture OR infrastructure, OR "IT" OR "ICT")). The search was carried out on Jan 15, 2018. We applied it to Article Title, Abstract and Keywords. This resulted in 991 results. This high volume was unsurprising due to the broad smart city context. Following <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[39]</ref>, we reviewed the abstracts of these papers and applied the inclusion and exclusion criteria. These are defined as follows:</p><p>Inclusion criteria (IC): (IC1) the paper must treat "hard" domains of SCSs, i.e. buildings, smart service networks, energy grids, natural resources, water management, waste management, mobility and logistics, where ICT plays the decisive role in the functions of the system; (IC2) the paper must treat explicitly requirements to the SCS -or the class of SCSs, that the paper talks about; (IC3) if multiple publications report the same study, only the most recent one is selected. Exclusion criteria (EC): (EC1) non-English publications; (EC2) papers dedicated to the "soft" domains of smart cities, i.e. education, culture, policy innovations, social inclusion, and government, (EC3) papers emphasizing the social context and social requirements such as language constraints, economic constraints, or geographic-specific aspects are not considered; and (EC4) articles that are not downloadable online.</p><p>The abstracts were read by both authors independently. The authors worked in different countries and had little communication between themselves (as the second author was employed in a company outside the Netherlands). Based on the review of the abstract, the authors discarded 870 papers. The whole texts of the remaining 121 papers were reviewed to assure we include only those relevant to our RQs. This step resulted in a final selection of 32 scientific articles which form references  in the reference list of this paper.</p><p>Our literature review revealed a variety of requirements addressed in the selected papers. For the purpose of this study, we classified these requirements in a framework of types of systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and in requirements categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref>. The types are those defined by Harrison et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>: (1) Instrumented systems are a category of SCSs responsible for capturing and integration of live real-world and virtual data; (2) Interconnected systems are a category of SCSs in which information is integrated throughout an end-to-end process; and (3) Intelligent systems are a category of SCSs whose critical functionality is the analysis of information to bring insights that drive decisions and action. Next, we employed the framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> of the British Standards Institute (BSI) which was derived based on the BSI's research of more than 100 standards applicable to SCSs. The framework suggests four dimensions that can be used to categorize the requirements that we extracted from the 32 papers: (i) End-to-End Experience, referring to holistic descriptions of the behavior of a SCSs; (ii) Architecture, referring to formal descriptions of information systems, in particular by defining components or building blocks and how they will work together; (iii) Security &amp; Privacy, referring to holistic descriptions of technology and policy aspects; as data is shared between services, concerns emerge over information security, data protection and privacy; (iv) Infrastructure, referring to descriptions of the infrastructure facilitating the interaction between elements within any subsystems as well as between subsystems. This interaction is enabled and supported by ICT and electronics <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>III. RESULTS</head><p>This section presents the demographics of our 32 papers and then describes our findings according to our RQs.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>A. Descriptive characteristics of the selected papers</head><p>Figures 1 and 2 describe the papers in terms of publication year and country of the authors' affiliations, respectively. Below, we see that 9 out of the 32 papers in our review, were published in 2014. A possible explanation for this is that a large number of inter-university projects funded by the European Union within the FP7 framework finished up in 2014 and the participating researchers had mature results to publish (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref>). Also, we observe a steady growth of publications in the following years <ref type="bibr">, 2015, 2016 and 2017</ref>. This matches the current developments in the field and the new funding schemas that have been launched after 2014. Next, <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> indicates that (i) the highest number of papers was published by researchers from Italy (6), UK (6) and Spain (4), and (ii) the majority of papers (29 out of 32) are from the countries in the European Union (EU). In fact, this is unsurprising, considering the EU's directive for development of smart cities and the funding schemas provided to universities and businesses to help with the execution of this directive.  </p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>B. Requirements that SCS should meet (RQ1)</head><p>Below, we report the applicable requirements <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Tables I, II,  III and IV)</ref>, first classified in one of the three types <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> of smart city systems (instrumented, interconnected and intelligent), and next, in Van Dam's four categories <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[36]</ref> (end-to-end experience, architecture, security &amp; privacy, infrastructure).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>1) End-to-end experience requirements.</head><p>We found that 13 out of the 32 papers addressed this requirements category. <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table I</ref> presents the requirements extracted from these papers. We observe that most of these requirements refer to interconnected systems and intelligent systems. We also notice that only one paper (see Batty et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>) addressed requirements regarding instrumented SCSs and that all those are about functional properties, e.g. abilities of collecting data, preparing data for analysis and transforming data. In contrast to this, we observe that the requirements regarding interconnected and intelligent smart systems are in fact quality requirements (or non-functional), e.g. interoperability <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, distributedness of data mining processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, or sematic integration.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>2) Architecture requirements</head><p>We found that 15 out of the 32 papers addressed this requirements category (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table II</ref>). <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table II</ref> indicates that these requirements are either at sensor level or at network level ones. The first address the topology of the sensors in a network and the topology's implications for architecture. These requirements acknowledge the understanding that the quality attributes of the resulting SCS depend on the architecture design choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>. Next, the network-level requirements deal with the rules postulating the communication of local networks and broader networks, such as Wi-Fi and 3G (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>). We observe that the authors of the papers that concern intelligent smart systems, put forward service requirements (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>3) Security and privacy requirements</head><p>We found that nine papers addressed this category of requirements (see <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Table III</ref>). An interesting observation is that six papers address security and privacy at the level of interconnected systems. Only one paper dealt with security of instrumented SCSs, and the specific requirements were concerned with identity management of citizens. </p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>C. Application domains traceable to the requirements (RQ2)</head><p>We found 8 application domains that were covered in the 32 papers included in this review: (i) e-government and mobility service provisioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31]</ref>, (ii) transportation, city traffic and parking usage optimization <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">27]</ref>, (iii) energy sustainability and optimization <ref type="bibr">[2,13,15,21,22,28,31, (iv)</ref> city pollution, microclimate, and noise monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref>, (v) logistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29]</ref>, (vi) waste management <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref>, (vii) smart homes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>, and (v) geographic information systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>. While it is not surprising that e-government and mobility service provisioning, transportation and energy optimization are the most researched domains, it is unexpected that only one out of our 32 included papers deals with smart homes -knowing that both the market of smart homes and the number of connected devices per family in Europe has grown dramatically in the past three years, according to EU reports (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>).</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>IV. DISCUSSION ON RESULTS AND ON VALIDITY</head><p>As <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">Tables I, II, III</ref> and IV indicate, the majority of the identified requirements fell into the end-to-end experience and architectural categories. Few focused on security and citizens' privacy. This hints that SCS researchers might well take for granted the resolution of possible security and privacy challenges. Plus, there might be tacit expectation that existing standards would be enough as solutions in the lower layers of SCSs. However, the rapid expansion and the diversity of technologies most likely will challenge these standards as they were originally designed for different scales and problems. Therefore, we think that more research is needed on security strategies for smart cities. Second, we observe that published research took a bottom-up approach to SCS. The architectural requirements <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table II)</ref> are in fact design-level requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> referring to sensors and networks, and not to constituent systems in a system-of-systems solution providing services to stakeholders. This is in contrast to top-down approaches to requirements in which the analysis starts from stakeholders' goals and needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>. We found very few articles ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32]</ref>) stating SCS stakeholders and these did not go deep but discussed them in general. A significant direction for future work is therefore the deeper understanding of involved stakeholders and the SCS services that match their needs. Third, regarding infrastructure requirements, we found that many papers are hard to associate to a particular SCS category <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. E.g. in <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, 12], <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>, we found some pieces of requirements applicable to the instrumented systems, while others were more logical to be associated to the interconnected systems or the intelligent systems category (such as the requirements from <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>). This difficulty in associating the infrastructure requirements to a particular category might signal that the SCS categorization in <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> is not fine-grained enough to classify infrastructure requirements.</p><p>Last, we compared our findings with other empirical studies of EU agencies on the distribution of smart cities (e.g. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>). The findings in <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">Figure 2</ref> agree with the data of the EU study <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref> which indicated Italy, UK and Spain as the countries with the highest concentration of smart cities (p. 39). It is therefore unsurprising that the majority of the papers included in our review originate from those countries. Moreover, we found that the application domains for which we identified requirements also agree with the domains that have seen the highest number of SCSs implementation projects ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>).</p><p>We evaluated the possible threats to the validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">39]</ref> of our results. First, if another researcher reviews the papers' abstracts would he or she decide for including or excluding the same papers? To make sure this threat was limited, we reviewed independently the abstracts of the papers. If our evaluation of the inclusion/exclusion differed, they we clarified our differences in a discussion and arrived to a consensus. This enhanced our understanding of the criteria and their application. Moreover, both authors know no author among those of the included papers. This reduces the possibility of injecting professional bias in the selection of the studies, due to friendship or prior collaboration. Next, although Scopus is considered the most comprehensive library in terms of coverage, it might be the case that a highly relevant paper has not been included in it. This poses a validity threat. However, we think it is minimal because we found that quite a few journal papers had already shorter earlier versions that were already published in conferences. This signaled to us that the research studies included in this review are mature and the authors re-thought their ideas as a result of writing journal papers that have gone through a more rigorous review process compared to conference and workshop papers. Last, we are conscious about the possible bias in classifying the 32 papers according to Harrison et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>. We found that at times it was quite difficult to assign a paper to only one category of smart systems (be it instrumental, interconnected and intelligent SCSs). This is because some of our selected 32 papers provided a more detailed contextual description of their SCS of interest than others. To counter the risk of bias, the respective texts from the papers in question, were discussed by both researchers and the categorization was done once consensus was achieved.</p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head>V. SUMMARY AND IMPLICATIONS</head><p>A systematic review of literature was performed, to identify requirements for SCSs. An initial set of 991 articles was screened in a two-stage process, yielding a set of 32 papers used to extract requirements to SCSs <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Tables I -IV)</ref>. We found that that (i) so far research took a bottom-up approach to defining SCS requirements; we see a strong focus on requirements important for designing a scalable architecture that could include any device or system <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Table II, based on 15</ref> papers out of 32 in our set); (ii) end-to-end experience requirements received attention in literature, however they so far are translated in feature-level functional requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref> and two non-functional requirements: interoperability and level of standardization; (iii) very little is mentioned on security and privacy requirements that are key to the SCS acceptance; (iv) infrastructure requirements are founded on standards and are prescriptive in nature; they recommend very specific solutions leveraging already existing technology choices.</p><p>This review has at least three implications for practitioners: (1) SCS vendors might find it informative to compare their proposed solutions against the list of requirements identified in this paper; (2) client organizations who are interested in implementing SCS concepts might use our list <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">(Tables I -IV)</ref> as an initial set of requirements that could be further elaborated to match their own context; (3) clients might also be interested in comparing different vendors' SCS offerings by using our list of requirements, as a common ground for comparison. This review has some implications for researchers: (1) those schools that were so far involved in smart city projects under the FP7 and Horizon 2020 programs could use our list of requirements for understanding better the scope of the systems that their projects deliver and for delimiting this scope; (2) researchers could possibly use the requirements as a roadmap if they focus on a particular type <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> of a SCS, e.g. an instrumental SCS; (3) researchers might also use the findings to compare the outcomes of their different projects. We consider however these application scenarios of the requirements as working assumptions; therefore we plan future work with colleagues from smart city research projects to see the extent to which the requirements could add value to research in the scenarios we hypothesized.</p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc>Fig. 1.
